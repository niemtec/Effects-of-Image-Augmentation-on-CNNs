# Binary Cancer Classifier (v1.0)
This is the initial step in the Turing project.
It contains a basic, and a rather inefficient, neural network designed to classify images of dermal nevi as either cancerous or benign.

It was ran on the SENTINEL hardware with a GTX960. A run of 50 epochs took about 7 hours to complete.
The network was able to achieve 85-95% accuracy at that time and the weights for that run have been exported. (Batch size of 15)
