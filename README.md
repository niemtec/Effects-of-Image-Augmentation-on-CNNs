This repository hosts the primary digital artifact from an investigation into phenomena of overfitting in convolutional neural networks.

The **demo** directory contains a scaled-down version of the dataset and pre-configured demonstration of how image rotation and noise augmentation networks operate whilst training.
Results of the demo training are saved in he respective **demo-results** folder.

The core network structure, merged from two separate brances, can be found in the **binary-classifier-network.py** file, and its respective versions in general experiments branches.
