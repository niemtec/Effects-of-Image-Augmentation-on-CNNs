A research repository consisting of various experiments and sample code in aid of the "TURING" project.
Various references and experiments have been contained to their individual directories for easier organisation.

##### Aims
* To investigate various methods of generating convolutional neural netowkrs (CNNs)
* To investigate how to use CNNs in adversarial scenarios
* To investigate how genetic algorithms (GAs) can be used in the position of an "attacker" agent against a CNN
